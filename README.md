# rbm

Well here it is the code that others regarded as unholy.

My first attempt at a Restricted Boltzmann

I hope you like it, it still needs a lot more work to get it to a reasonable standard:

Faults are that it is set at only 1 gibbs sample - doesnt seem right.

Innaccurate not 100% on recall / reconstruction of Xor

Ideal for anyone wishing to code an RBM in C++ for beginers like me!

Just needs g++ and your ready to go.

Thanks
